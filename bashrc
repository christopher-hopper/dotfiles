#

#
# Don't wait for job termination notification
# set -o notify
#
# Don't use ^D to exit
# set -o ignoreeof
#
# Use case-insensitive filename globbing
# shopt -s nocaseglob

# Make bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk
# shopt -s histappend
#
# When changing directory small typos can be ignored by bash
# for example, cd /vr/lgo/apaache would find /var/log/apache

# Completion options
#
# These completion tuning parameters change the default behavior of bash_completion:
#
# Define to avoid stripping description in --option=description of './configure --help'
# COMP_CONFIGURE_HINTS=1
#
# Define to avoid flattening internal contents of tar files
# COMP_TAR_INTERNAL_PATHS=1
#

# Bash Completion
# 
# Enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable
# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile
# sources /etc/bashrc).
